# What's this?

This really hacky piece of crap JS/React takes the output from a DOS `dir` command and makes it in to HTML that you can paste in (as source) to a SharePoint wiki page.

Actually you can use the output anywhere -- it's just links to your folders that it generates. I just built it specifically for SharePoint.

Instructions to get your directory listing are in `src/data/output.js`. Then just `yarn start` and open up a browser.

Let me know on [the forum](https://forum.johnnydecimal.com) if you get stuck. I knocked this up in half a day, it ain't great.
